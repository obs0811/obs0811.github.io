I'm a software engineer. I always try to learn from experiences (trials and errors) and hope to share it with other people. This blog is for logging my daily thoughts and notes primarily covering the subjects of computing. I'm also interested in recent advancements in computer science research. Besides, I love watching movies and football. Thanks for visiting :)
